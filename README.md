Here are important pointers:

Recruiters and hiring managers only spend about 7 seconds skimming your resume. Neglecting the resume summary is a wasted opportunity. Whether you are a recent graduate, a career-changer, or a job seeker with diverse experience, you can greatly benefit from having a strong and compelling resume summary. A well-written resume summary can quickly grab the attention of recruiters and increase your chances of getting an interview. The professional summary focuses on your key skills, achievements, and experiences and convinces the employer why you are the best person for the job. It is essential that you include relevant keywords in your resume to get it past the ATS. Use Jobscanâ€™s Resume Optimization Tool to make your resume ATS-friendly and optimized.
